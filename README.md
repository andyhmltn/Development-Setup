My Development Setup
=========

This is a (soon to be) set of scripts to setup my development environment on a new Ubuntu Server. Hopefully I'll migrate this over and start using Chef at some point, but I haven't had the chance to wrap my head around it just yet.

How to use
-----

Just run `sudo ./install.sh`

What does it install?
